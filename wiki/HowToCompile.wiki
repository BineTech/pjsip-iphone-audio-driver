#summary One-Compiling pjsip and audio driver for iPhone SDK

= Introduction =

In order to provide precise step-by-step build instructions, we've opted to write these instructions to target a specific version of PJSIP. We recommend you follow these instructions to the letter first (so you have a working build) before venturing off to another version of PJSIP.


= Step 1 =

Download PJSIP v1.0.3 from subversion. Open up your terminal, and execute the following 2 commands:

  * cd ~/Desktop
  * svn checkout http://svn.pjsip.org/repos/pjproject/tags/1.0.3 pjsip

This will create a folder called "pjsip" on your Desktop, and download the 1.0.3 release into that folder. The rest of the instructions assume the folder is on your Desktop.

= Step 2 =

Download the latest version of the iPhone audio driver from the Downloads page.

Then place the downloaded audio driver file into the location:<br/>
~/Desktop/pjsip/pjmedia/src/pjmedia/iphonesound.c

= Step 3 =

Download the pjsip-patch-1_0_3.txt from the Downloads page.<br/>
Then place the downloaded patch file on your Desktop.

= Step 4 =

Apply the patch file by executing the following two commands:

  * cd ~/Desktop/pjsip
  * patch -p1 < ../pjsip-patch-1_0_3.txt

= Step 5 =

Compile pjsip by executing the following 3 commands:

  * cd ~/Desktop/pjsip
  * chmod 755 compile.sh
  * ./compile.sh
